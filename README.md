#App Installation Guide:
1. Open two terminals (split terminal)
2. In the first terminal, cd into backend directory and in second, cd into frontend directory
3. In backend run pip install -r requirements.txt -> after installation, run: python main.py
4. In the frontend directory run: npm install -> after installation run: npm dev

Note -> There may be a cool-down period for the app to properly run after starting the local host server. Sometimes, a restart may be needed.
