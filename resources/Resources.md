Purpose:
The idea of this application is to create a collection manager which will show a collection of items. For my application, I have decided to create a collection of movies. This collection manager will make it easier to view and edit the items in the collection. For example, filters can be added to only show specific items instead of the entire collection manager at once. 

Requirements:

1.	Users should be able to add additional items to the collection manager.
2.	Users should be able to edit existing items in the collection manager.
3.	Users should be able to group items into categories, filtering on those categories.
